osx_handmade_minimal
====================

A port of Handmade Hero (http://handmadehero.org) for OS X.

This version is a demonstration of how to create the app without
using Xcode or xib files. This is a work in progress.

See the osx_handmade repository for the "standard" OS X version
that uses an Xcode project.



IMPORTANT
---------
I removed Casey's game code source files from this repository.

Once you clone or update from this repository, copy over the
following files from Casey's source code:
  handmade_platform.h
  handmade.h
  handmade.cpp

This repository works with Casey's handmade.cpp/h files from
handmade_hero_029_source.

The original version of Handmade Hero is being created by Casey Muratori.
