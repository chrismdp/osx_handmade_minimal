osx_handmade_minimal
====================

A port of Handmade Hero (http://handmadehero.org) for OS X.

This version is a demonstration of how to create the app without
using Xcode or xib files. This is a work in progress.

See the osx_handmade repository for the "standard" OS X version
that uses an Xcode project.



IMPORTANT
---------
I removed Casey's platform-independent game code from this repository.

Once you clone or update from this repository, copy over the
following files from Casey's source code:
- handmade_intrinsics.h
- handmade_platform.h
- handmade.h
- handmade.cpp

This repository works with Casey's source code from
handmade_hero_day_029_source through (at least) handmade_hero_day_032_source.

The original version of Handmade Hero is being created by Casey Muratori.
